## Systemic Issues
 - how do we integrate mongoc's error handling with c++'s error handling facilities
 - how do we integrate mongoc's memory management with c++'s memory management facilities
 - header include discipline (eg. do we put package prefixes?)
 - are we going to put type tags on closing braces? (we are inconsistent now)
